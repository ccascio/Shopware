## OVERVIEW

Shopware is awesome... well, it will be... eventually!
Currently it's more... a work in progress, which is very promising! Just like the idea behind this App.

So what's the idea? Well, many people complain that they would like to know better what they are buying, where it comes from, if it is not overpriced, if it is safe! Don't you? I do... especially when I look at that blinking apples I bought yesterday... is it supposed to do that? 0_O
Shopware would like to crowdsource the awareness!
